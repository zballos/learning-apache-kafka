# Schema Registry

It is a tool for managing Kafka schemas, providing a Restful API for controller and versioning schemas in Avro, JsonSchema and Protobuff.

The great advantage is that, with a centralized environment, everyone must follow the same contract. The producer defines the message and all consumers.
